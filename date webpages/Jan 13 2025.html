    <h1> <i> January 13<sup>th</sup>, 2025</i></h1>

    <p> Been a little busy with life in general. Even if I stopped writing this for a few days, doesn't mean I haven't been studying HTML and CSS!
    <br> I've learned how tables, image icons (favicons) are made, how to set a title to my webpages! 
    <br> I haven't really changed the other page's titles and stuff mostly to show the difference in learning in between one another. 
    <br> Also updated all of the URLs from absolute to relative, so that everytime I make a change, everything keeps being the same as is. Learning about the existence of <q>./</q> and <q>../</q> was a complete game changer! </p>

    <p> Updated the CSS file drastically so that the page looks a little cleaner. Still doesn't look even close to the modern pages (and it probably never will, not that it matters), but at least it's looking like a mid-90s page! 
    <br> I'm guessing things will only get harder as I keep learning, and I haven't gotten to div's yet (I'm planning to start learning about them today though), so for now, things are pretty accessible, even if a little bit confusing at times. 
    </p>

    <p> I've decided to start making a Pok&eacute;mon personal database, where I will contain useful information from whatever Pok&eacute;mon game I'm playing. 
    <br> I'm guessing I'm going to start playing a lot of Pok&eacute;mon videogames, since my boyfriend likes them so much. 
    <br> But that one will be taking a while, since they're so bloated with content, you almost need a full-time job to 100% a single game. </p>

    <p> I went back to work last Saturday. It felt great to go back to it. It was probably the first event I managed solo without any mistakes! 
    <br> I'm not managing this situation very well, my head has been a mess. Can't get my thoughts straight, I can't stop thinking about how I don't want to leave this line of work. 
    <br> It's better to stop now and pursue something else this early on,. but I just have so much fun at work that I don't really know what to do... 
    <br> I remember telling my therapist back when I had sessions that I didn't care what kind of job I did, so long as I had a stable income and enough to pay rent and taxes and still have some left. I'm realizing that what I said wasn't true... 
    <br> I mean, the <q>stable income</q> part still holds true, but the job I do DOES matter, that I'm not the kind of person who can just do anything and be happy doing it. I need to do something I like as a job in the long run, otherwise I'll just feel miserable. 
    <br> I'm glad I'm enjoying learning HTML and CSS so far, if I keep enjoying it, this might just become my alternative. 
    <br> I have no idea on what the future holds, so I can't say anything for certain, but I really hope I don't get tired of this. I mean, I know I will eventually, everyone does at some point. But at least I'll do what I can to not drop this.</p>

    <p>I've started emulating games. I can't believe I haven't done that before! 
    <br> started by emulating a PS2, so I could play some of my childhood games again. Boy, I missed Theme Park World, WRC Rally Evolved, Gran Turismo 4 and Katamari Damacy! 
    <br> Since it's been a pain doing all this researching for it, I'm dropping all the files I have for the emulators on a different page that I'll link in my main one, Once I learn how to.
    <br> For now, I'll just drop the links to the webistes that I've used so far that I know are safe to download from, along with the websites for the emulators I'm using.</p>
