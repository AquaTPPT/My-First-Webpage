        <p>I have learned how to make divs and classes. Look, all these boxes are made with that! 
            <br>I'm getting to know a lot about more resources to learn about web development, so I think this is going in the right track. 
            <br>I'm practicing HTML and CSS every day without exception, I just haven't really made these over the crappy schedule I'm setting for these. 
            <br>I have also learned how to make an iframe, so now this can be read through my main website! 
            <br>I'm guessing that the "general style.css" file I've been using can't really be fully used in these pages though, since they will look weird in the iframe resolution, but I'll take care of that tomorrow.

        <p>I'm finally realizing how much I've grown as a person these past few days. I remember going through something as painful as this and at the time I just holed up in my room without doing anything. But now here I am, learning a whole new career path! 
            <br>I think everything is going to be okay. I'm really optimistic for the future! 
            <br>My biggest fear behind all this is getting tired of this. I know how I am when I get tired of something, even though I set myself to do this, and despite that meaning that, even if I do get bored or fed up with this, it'll mean that I have to keep going. 
            <br>Thankfully, I have people who keep pushing me to keep going, and a great boyfriend that is constantly providing me support. I hope this relationship keeps going for a long time, really. 
            <br>I know I shouldn't be thinking about this, because it always jinxes everything, but I am really scared that he just shows up one day and tells me that he lost interest in me. 
            <br>I'm guessing that's what it means to love someone, but still. I hate this feeling, because it never fades away. 
            <br>Even though I know he's someone who is always in his own world (he's not autistic, not that that's a problem for me), but sometimes I'm fearful of what the future holds in that regard.</p>
