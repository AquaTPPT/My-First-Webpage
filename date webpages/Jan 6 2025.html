<h1> <i> January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025</i></h1>

<p> So I'm learning formatting, how to write citations, subscripted and superscripted text. doing all these things is pretty intuitive. it takes a lot of time though, since you have to write everything EXACTLY how you want it. <br> gone are the days of being babied by Microsoft Word! <br> I'm still learning other parts of working with HTML. My page still looks very messy, which is also a big part due to my lack of patience and eye for decoration haha, and also because I still don't know CSS. I'll get there eventually... <br> switching to Visual Studio made things a lot faster though. The fact that it automatically suggests some <q>tags</q> and <q>attributes</q> is REALLY helpful! <br> Also, <b> I can write things in bold now!</b> <b style="color:rgb(0, 256, 0)"> and in a different color at the same time!</b> <br> I am actually having fun here, which is something I never thought would happen this early on. <br> I had tried programming before with Python and C#, but i never really had that much fun. Is it because I can see my results straight away?</p> 
    
<p> On a different note, I've been listening to a lot of jazz lately. I know I always gravitated towards it, since I love a lot of the old sounding records from the 50's, 60's, and 70's. <br> I liked the idea of sharing some of the things I'm currently listening, so I shall share them in the same fashion as before.</p>
    
<p> I'm still listening to Chet Baker a lot. There's something to the rawness of his voice, the fact that you can clearly tell that he's not very used to singing that is hipnotizing. <br> I know, it sounds weird, and I can't really explain it. <br> Maybe this is why it sold so well when it was released. <br> Here's another song from the same album with the same cover. </p>

<p> It's so comforting to listen to him sing, and, even though I don't relate to the lyrics, it's still a great listen. </p>
    
<p> Moving on to the next! I've been madly in love with this new band called Fontaines D.C. THey're a punk band that does things so differently from most punk bands I've listened to. <br> Even if you don't enjoy punk as a genre, you should give it a try, even though it is a very depressive song. <br> I'm placing the first song from their last album, <q>Romance.</q> </p>
