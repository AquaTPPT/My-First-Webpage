    <div class="content">
        <p>I have recently started using a new website to learn Web development. In fact, I tried many of them, but most weren't very good. 
            It's not exactly the website's fault, I think, it was just strange using them </p>

        <p> I tried CodeCademy at first, since I had already learned 80% of what I'm supposed to learn about HTML at W3Schools (I also learned a little bit about CSS, as I think you can see), but I tried moving on to JavaScript. 
            <br> I can't exactly explain how to put into words what I was feeling about using the course, other than the fact that practically everything is behind a paywall. 
            Most I can say about it is that it <q>babies</q> you a lot.
            <br> Maybe that's fine for most people, but to me it wasn't. I like the kind of learning where they tell me to <q>hit the books</p>, You know what I mean? 
                Like, I'm an actual grown man (weird, right?), I don't need to be babied into learning everything! If anything, it makes you either develop an ego or show how little you actually know! 
            <br> I'm most likely reading too much into this, but yeah, I didn't really like it.
        </p>
        <p> So after I started the introductory JavaScript course (which showed how different it actually is from HTML and CSS, it actually feels like a programming language), I moved on to this website called <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank" alt="The Odin Project" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a> 
            <br>From what I understood, it's a website dedicated to learn about Web Development, completely open-source and editable, that has been made and maintained by Web Devs! 
            <br>I am completely in love with this community. Everyone helps you so much, and <b>most</b> people don't really make you feel like what you're asking is obvious. Well, so long as what you're having issues with isn't <q>Googleable</q>. 
            <br>I'm still at the early stages of the introductory course. I thought about moving on straight into the second one, but I'm really, really glad I didn't. 
            <br>I finally understand what everyone was on about. It's not like I didn't see the comments people made about W3Schools, and to be honest, I wouldn't be able to make this website as complete as it is right now without them, but there were some things that should have been addressed from the start, or, like they do, mentioned as something that should be placed, but that <q>will be talked about in more detail later on</q>. 
            <br>The first thing they did was give me a bunch of resources to do research, blog posts by developers concerned about some problems and detailing differences between elements, tags, attributes and entities that <em>seem</em> like they don't really have a difference, but definitely do in the long run, or have different contexts behind them.
