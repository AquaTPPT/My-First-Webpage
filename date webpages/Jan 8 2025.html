    <h1> <i> January 8<sup>th</sup>, 2025</i></h1>

    <p>I started playing around with CSS today, I have updated the whole webpage so that the formatting is all included in just one external CSS file! <br>
    I still need to have a couple things in mind though, even if I'll be starting to make changes to everything over time so that I can have an easier time looking at it. <br>
    It'll also be a great way to see how much I progressed!</p>

    <p>I was pretty confused at how the CSS code language looked at first. It may be pretty simple, but it didn't look like it to me at first. <br>
    I had a couple issues with it at first. While doing the initial formatting, I thought I was doing something wrong with the p and h1 tags, since they weren't showing up how I wanted them to, but it was just me that was placing too little values for the margins and the borders. <br>
    </p>

    <p>I'm slowly but surely understanding how everything works, even if some things still show up broken in the exercises I'm doing every now and then. </p>

    <p> I woke up really depressed today. I still can't get over the fact that I was careless and damaged my hearing beyond repair. <br>
    It's awful to cut my sound technician career short over something like this. It's really, really painful to have to say goodbye to all this in such a terrible fashion. <br>
    But at least it was very early on in my career, so I can still pursue something else. <br>
    I still don't know what to do next, since all I ever knew in my life was music. But I'll figure something out, I always do.</p>

    <p> Haven't listened to anything noteworthy today, so I suppose that there won't be any songs this time.</p>
