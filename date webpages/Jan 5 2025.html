    <h1> <i> January 5<sup>th</sup>, 2025</i></h1>

    <p> I can use images now, it seems. It looks like placing an image in HTML is simpler than it looks.<br>Here, I'm posting an image:</p>
    
    <img src="../assets/yabuki_Joe.jpg" alt="Joe Yabuki from Ashita no Joe">
    
    <p>One of my favourite characters... ever, really, now placed into my very first self-made page. I like this!</p>
    
    <p>This page is still looking a little rough, I'm feeling like I'm back in the 90's, they don't make them like this anymore! But that's fine, I'm still learning slowly but surely. I'll be able to make the main contents of this page right now! I can take care of decorating once I reach a higher level and (probably) CSS, but since I haven't really coded much before, I still have no idea.</p>

    <p>If you somehow stumbled upon this page and you're wondering how I'm learning to do these lines of code and making them into a website, I am using an online resource called W3schools! I'm really enjoying !, so I might as well do some free publicity :D<br> Here, I'll even drop a link:</p>
    
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> (yes, this is a way of making me practice creating hyperlinks, I apologize for shilling a website like this.)</a>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p style="padding-top: 10px;">Well, while I'm at it, I might as well show off some things that I like.<br>I love music, art, videogames and anime.<br> lately I've been listening to a lot of Chet Baker. I can show a song that I love from him. I'm creating a link on the album covers, once I figure out how to. I hope you enjoy it. </p>

    <p> Oh wow, I just had my very first error message! The first of many, I suppose. 
        <br> It seems like I just made a very dumb mistake, where I forgot to close the img brackets BEFORE closing the link tag. 
        <br> That's a mistake that I hope I won't make anymore, because I haven't been this confused looking at an error message before</p>
