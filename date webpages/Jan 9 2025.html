    <h1> <i> January 9<sup>th</sup>, 2025</i></h1>

    <p>I started placing the attributes separated from the tags in the code. In these simpler projects, it makes everything more readable. A slight change I suppose, but since I'm learning and the purpose of this code is to be able to have a look at what I did and clearly see what I did in a very consise way, I think it's a little better, since so long as they're inside the brackets, I can place them wherever I want. <br>
    Learning a little bit more in depth about links, styles and images is really good, even if it is pretty redundant at this point. HTML doesn't have many options when it comes to these things, so seeing the same information over and over, despite it being a good way to memorize different concepts, is a little annoying. </p>

    <p>Recently I started looking at what other developers and programmers think odf W3Schools as a teaching area, and the reviews are pretty mixed. <br>
    I'm no programmer, nor have I ever worked in the industry, but it seems like a good place to start. I'm not going to use it as my only source though, I'm going to other webistes, probably to codecademy next, whilst going to websites that offer challenges. <br>
    I'm not sure if I can use this website as portfolio though, but I will be making a bunch of templates once I complete a ton of coding challenges. I'll ask what some programmers that I know of think of this idea and place it in here in a later note, might prove useful to someone, who knows. <br>
    </p>

    <p>I still can't make anything TOO complicated though, but that's okay I think. I have a lot of time to learn.</p>

    <p>I know how to float pictures now!</p>



    <p>Pretty cool, right? 
        <br> I'm guessing this is good for advertisements and stuff, things you want to stand out over anything else that the page is displaying. Regardless, I like it! 
        <br> Still don't know how to place an image properly though.

    <p>Been watching a lot of YouTube these past few days. I mean, I normally did before, but I've been a little addicted to video essays. Some channels are really good at making them, I can't seem to get enough! 
        <br> I'm placing some cool YouTube Channels so that everyone can see and appreciate like I do.</p>

    <p>Probably one of my favourites, Nexpo covers a lot of unsettling, disturbing and horrow-related stuff, from things he finds on the internet to cases like the Elan school. Definitely worth a watch! </p>

    <p>Super Eyepatch Wolf is also really, really good. He is someone who makes video essays on whatever he wants, without there being a connection other than being things he's passionate about or that he feels like it should be brought into the spotlight.</p>

    <p>I used to binge Ahoy's videos when I was younger. His polybius video is on par with some documentaries I have seen in TV, amazing stuff. This one is a must! </p>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@XboxAhoy" alt=Ahoy target="_blank">Ahoy</a>

    <p> And last, but definitely not least, there's LEMMiNO. His documentaries are probably the highest quality I have found yet, with incrediuble reasearch, attention to detail and with always a different type of rendering to them. <br>
    This one id by far the most importantoone to wathc, and deserves all the attention he's getting.</p>

    <p> I suppose this has become a full on blog at this point. Might as well embrace it and keep going with it!</p>
